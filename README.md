#Energy Consumption Forecasting with LSTM
A project for forecasting hourly energy consumption in buildings using a recurrent neural network (LSTM).

#Project description

This project was created as part of a coursework assignment for a master's degree program. The goal is to predict the energy consumption of a building (a hospital in the US) based on historical data using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model.
The time series covers 1 year (8760 hours). The predictions can be useful for optimizing energy consumption and load planning.
